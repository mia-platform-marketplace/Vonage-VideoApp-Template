// You'll need to adjust the code above by hard coding the values for the apiKey, sessionId and
// token. To do this, log into your TokBox Account, either create a new OpenTok API project
// or use an existing OpenTok API project, then go to your project page and scroll down to the
// Project Tools section â€” from there, you can generate a Session ID and Token manually

// You can continue to get the session ID and token values from your Account during testing
//  and development, but before you go into production you must set up a server.
